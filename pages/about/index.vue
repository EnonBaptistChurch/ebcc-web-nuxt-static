      <h3><strong>Welcome To Enon Baptist Church</strong></h3>

      <p>
        We are a group of people who meet together to worship God. We are concerned for one another and those who live around us. We believe the Bible to be God’s Word, relevant to all areas of life. In particular, we have a personal belief in Jesus Christ and through Him have a real relationship with God.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone is given a warm welcome at Enon. Our worship is God-focused and traditional in style. We sing hymns, read the Bible, pray, and listen to God speak through the preaching of His Word. After the services we share tea and coffee, and most people stay to get to know each other better and encourage one another — all are welcome to stay.
      </p>
