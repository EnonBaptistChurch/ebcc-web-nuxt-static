        <h1>Sunday Club</h1>
        <p><strong>Every Sunday from 9.45 &#8211; 10.45am.</strong></p>
        <p>Each week, the children are taught a lesson from the Bible in age groups. We follow a syllabus that covers the main teaching of the Bible over a five-year period.<br />
        There is also singing, a quiz and if children come regularly they can choose rewards. </p>
        <p>We go on some trips and have some fun activities for those attending. </p>
        <p>Lifts can be provided to and from local roads. </p>
        <p>At a time when morals are often ignored, it is important to consider the spiritual needs of today&#8217;s children.<br />
        Why not send your children to our Sunday Club? They will be very welcome. </p>
