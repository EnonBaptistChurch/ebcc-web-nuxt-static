            <strong>Wednesday at 7:30 pm</strong> – We value the Bible as God’s Word and meet each week to study it and learn from its teaching. We also spend time in prayer, seeking God’s help in all that we do as a church and praying for the advance of the Gospel (the good news about Jesus) around the world.
