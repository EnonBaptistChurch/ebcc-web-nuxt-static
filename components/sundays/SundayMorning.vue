    <h1>Sunday Morning Service - 11:15AM</h1>
    <p>Join us for our Sunday morning service, where we gather to worship, pray, and hear from God's Word.</p>
    
    <p>Parents with little ones are welcome too! There’s a crèche available in the room just behind the pastor, where you can take your children if needed.</p>
    <p>For older children, we provide sermon worksheets partway through the service to help them engage with what’s being taught.</p>
